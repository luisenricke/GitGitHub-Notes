## Gunnar Overgaard and Karin Palmkvist ~ Use Cases: Patterns and Blueprint

 Include vs Extend

> A few words of advice: Do not overuse the extend and the include 
> relationships in your model, because they add to the complexity and to 
> the size of the model. The extension and the inclusion use cases should 
> make it easier to understand and maintain the model. Such a use case 
> should either have an explicit value to the stakeholders, in the same 
> way as ordinary use cases do, or be required by one of the stakeholders.
> Otherwise, its behavior should be merged into the base use case(s) and 
> the extension/inclusion use case should be removed from the model. 
> Overuse of relationships between use cases results in unnecessarily 
> complex models that are hard to understand.

> Use-case descriptions often include a final section called *Special Requirements*. Any requirements regarding this use case that are not naturally included in the flow descriptions can be listed here. In particular, this includes nonfunctional requirements, such as requirements on response time, time out, number of concurrent users, and so on. Many projects prefer to collect all such requirements in a separate document; if so, this section is excluded.
